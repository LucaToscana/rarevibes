    "intro": "Rare Vibes is a space created to give visibility to those who create with passion. We love independent music, visual art that speaks without filters, and everything born from a sincere idea. Here, you can share your creativity freely, without labels.\nWe want to build an authentic place where creators can be seen, share their work, and find a real community — curious and ready to listen.\nRare Vibes started from a simple idea: a developer passionate about music and creativity wanted to build a space not driven by algorithms or trends. That’s how this project began, growing little by little with every artist who trusts us.\nWe believe in authenticity, quality, sincere sharing, and freedom of expression. No barriers, no competition. Just art, passion, and the desire to tell your story.",
